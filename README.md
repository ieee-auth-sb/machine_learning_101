# machine-learning-101
This is a beginners workshop about machine learning held on 2019 Bioengineering Hackathon of [EMB IEEE Student Chapter AUTH](https://www.facebook.com/embsauth/) by the Machine Learning Study Group of [IEEE AUTH SB](http://ieeesb.ee.auth.gr/).

## Installation
You need to install Python in order to run these scripts.

## Presentations
* A how to Python presentation in `Python-workshop.pdf` is made for beginners to learn the python syntax and how to use basic python libraries, such as numpy and pandas. If this is your first time with python, start from here.
* The complete workshop presentation is in `Machine Learning 101.pdf`.

## File list
 * In `Linear Regression.py` a basic regression problem is demonstrated using the `insurance.csv` dataset. The same code is also presented as a jupyter notebook script in the `Linear Regression.ipynb`.
 * In `SVM script.py` a basic svm is created in order to solve a classification problem using the `KaggleV2-May-2016.csv` dataset. The whole process is divided into steps for better understanding.
 * In `svm_example.py` another classification problem from the `bill_authentication.csv` dataset is being solved.
